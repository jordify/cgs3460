printf("-%-5.3d-%-10.3f-", 85, 0.0225);
  Printed to the screen will be "-085  -0.022     -"; a dash followed by
  the three digit representation of the integer 85 (085) left justified 
  in 5 spaces, then a dash followed by the 3 significant figure 
  representation of 0.0225 (0.022) left justified in ten spaces, finally 
  a dash.
scanf("%f%d%f", &x, &y, &z); // for "3 2.1 1.2"
  x will be given the float value 3.0, y will be given the integer value
  2, and z will be given the float value 0.1. 1.2 will not be read 
  because scanf will match the %d to the second user inputed value "2.1" 
  and will match the .1 portion to the last float.
