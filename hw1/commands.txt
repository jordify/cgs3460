OS: GNU/Linux. Specifically:
Linux shih 2.6.38-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Apr 22 17:48:36 UTC 2011 i686 Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU 6300 @ 1.86GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux

List the contents of the current directory:
  `ls`
  I did not use arguments with the ls command but you can use -l to list 
  the directory with each item on its own line and -a to list hidden 
  files and folders.

Display the contents of a file on screen:
  `cat file.txt`
  The argument is the file you would like to show on screen.

Display the path to the current directory:
  `pwd`
  No arguments.

Change to another directory:
  `cd /path/to/directory`
  The argument is the path to the target directory.

Create a directory:
  `mkdir directoryName`
  The argument is the path (relative to the working directory) of the 
  directory to be created.

Copy the contents of one file to another:
  `cp sourceFile destinationFile`
  The cp command will copy the contents of ``sourceFile'' to 
  ``destinationFile''

Delete a file from the disk:
  `rm file.txt`
  The argument is the file to be removed.
