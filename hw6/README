Before compiling please make sure the correct jpeg library object file
is being compiled. The second line in the makefile defines that object.

Once $(JPEGOBJ) is defined correctly, just run make to compile both
programs. All files needed for compilation are included in this tar
file. Notice that histogram has been split into a header file and source
file for easier program management and readability.
